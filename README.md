# GeneralsIO Bot Controller
An application to manage, program and test AI bots for Generals.io.

The main project is written in JavaScript. The application runs with Electron.

# Background
Generals.io is a web-based multiplayer strategy game where players move troops around a grid and try to take over other users' generals.

The developers have created a bot server and exposed a public API to allow players to create AI bots.

This project aims to facilitate the creation of these bots by providing an integrated environment to design, test and run bots.

Additionally, this platform may allow for human-assisted AI. For example, the user could create high-level commands such as `attack`, `expand` or `retreat` and use these commands in realtime with the AI performing the actions.
